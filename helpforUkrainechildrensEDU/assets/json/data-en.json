      "We teach children design, creating animations, games, sites, programs, help to create first IT-projects, develop skills of presentation, creative and logical thinking, interaction with peers and time management.",
      "<strong>Our graduates are independent developers</strong> who start their first technological startups or start working as freelancers before entering the university.

      "The best thing we can do now as an educational IT company is to continue our work and teach children so that each of them can discover and learn modern IT knowledge, despite the war we are living in. And we see how studying helps children experience a normal life.",
      "The team has decided that <strong>every child who wants to study should study! </strong>",
      "That is why GoITeens conducts free educational marathons and webinars for children from all over Ukraine and migrants, which will allow children to gain real practical knowledge and create their first IT projects.",
      "In addition, if possible, we give an opportunity to study our courses for free to all who need it.",
      "Friends, if you have the opportunity to help, the best help for us is the payment for teaching. We estimated that one child needs UAH 1,000/month to study free of charge, so we offer you to pay for tuition.",
      "The war will end! And together we will build the future of Ukraine. And our children will play a key role in it!",
